## Nameserver Verification

Using `list` with `--verify-ns` queries nameservers for the current (public) state of the zones and keys.

The results are displayed in additional columns. The first column is always `Parent` and contains `DS` if the corrresponding
DS record exists. One more column is generated for each nameserver queried for the zone and containts the letter `P` if
the key is published as a DNSKEY record and the letter `S` if it is used in any RRSIG signature. In case of lookup errors,
`ERR` is displayed.

## Key Rotation

Automatic ZSK key rotation tries to achieve a gap-less key schedule by providing overlapping active keys.
In an example configuration, `--prepublish 7d --lifetime 14d --overlap 5d --postpublish 7d`:

```
Days ->                          (1)
Key                               |
0      ..AAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIII--    V
1        PPPPPPPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIII--
2                 PPPPPPPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIII--
3                          PPPPPPPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIII--
```

Keys are automatically generated when they are needed to ensure the presence of a new key at the end of the lifetime
of a currently active key. At this point, the present options are applied, which may be used for a configuration change.

In the example above, at the day marked `(1)`, it would be detected that key 3 (which just became active) has no
successor. Therefore, one would be created with a pre-publication period starting two days later, as specified by the
lifetime and overlap.

New keys are generated with the same settings (algorithm, key size) as the newest key currently considered (key 4 in the
example). In order to change key parameters, locate this key and replace it with one having the new settings. Any
following key rotation will use those settings.
